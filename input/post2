<p>I can't go to juvie. They use guys like me as currency. Marge, it takes two to lie. One to lie and one to listen. Dad didn't leave... When he comes back from the store, he's going to wave those pop-tarts right in your face! We started out like Romeo and Juliet, but it ended up in tragedy.</p>
<p>The Internet King? I wonder if he could provide faster nudity... He didn't give you gay, did he? Did he?! Your guilty consciences may make you vote Democratic, but secretly you all yearn for a Republican president to lower taxes, brutalize criminals, and rule you like a king!</p>
