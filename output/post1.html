    <h2>star wars
 - april 22nd
</h2><hr /><p>You don't believe in the Force, do you? I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base. I don't know what you're talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan--  But with the blast shield down, I can't even see! How am I supposed to fight?</p>
<p>The Force is strong with this one. I have you now. I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here. I find your lack of faith disturbing.</p>
