    <h2>doctor who
 - january 3rd
</h2><hr /><p>I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks! Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time! Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I've always known him: Jeff. Annihilate? No. No violence. I won't stand for it. Not now, not ever, do you understand me?! I'm the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm - and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn't you?</p>
