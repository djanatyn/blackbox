</a> - april 22nd
</h2><hr /><p>You don't believe in the Force, do you? I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base. I don't know what you're talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan--  But with the blast shield down, I can't even see! How am I supposed to fight?</p>
<p>The Force is strong with this one. I have you now. I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here. I find your lack of faith disturbing.</p>

</h2><hr /><p>I can't go to juvie. They use guys like me as currency. Marge, it takes two to lie. One to lie and one to listen. Dad didn't leave... When he comes back from the store, he's going to wave those pop-tarts right in your face! We started out like Romeo and Juliet, but it ended up in tragedy.</p>
<p>The Internet King? I wonder if he could provide faster nudity... He didn't give you gay, did he? Did he?! Your guilty consciences may make you vote Democratic, but secretly you all yearn for a Republican president to lower taxes, brutalize criminals, and rule you like a king!</p><br />
