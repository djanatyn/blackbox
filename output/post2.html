    <h2>the simpsons
 - january 1st
</h2><hr /><p>I can't go to juvie. They use guys like me as currency. Marge, it takes two to lie. One to lie and one to listen. Dad didn't leave...

<p>The Internet King? I wonder if he could provide faster nudity... He didn't give you gay, did he? Did he?! Your guilty consciences may make you vote Democratic, but secretly you all yearn for a Republican president to lower taxes, brutalize criminals, and rule you like a king!</p><br />
