    <h2><a href='post1.html'>star wars
</a> - april 22nd
</h2><hr /><p>You don't believe in the Force, do you? I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base. I don't know what you're talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan--  But with the blast shield down, I can't even see! How am I supposed to fight?</p>
<p>The Force is strong with this one. I have you now. I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here. I find your lack of faith disturbing.</p>

<h2><a href='post2.html'>the simpsons
</a> - january 1st
</h2><hr /><p>I can't go to juvie. They use guys like me as currency. Marge, it takes two to lie. One to lie and one to listen. Dad didn't leave... When he comes back from the store, he's going to wave those pop-tarts right in your face! We started out like Romeo and Juliet, but it ended up in tragedy.</p>
<p>The Internet King? I wonder if he could provide faster nudity... He didn't give you gay, did he? Did he?! Your guilty consciences may make you vote Democratic, but secretly you all yearn for a Republican president to lower taxes, brutalize criminals, and rule you like a king!</p><br />
<h2><a href='post3.html'>monty python
</a> - january 2nd
</h2><hr /><p>It's only a model. Well, how'd you become king, then? And the hat. She's a witch! Shut up!</p>
<p>On second thoughts, let's not go there. It is a silly place. Oh! Come and see the violence inherent in the system! Help, help, I'm being repressed! The Knights Who Say Ni demand a sacrifice!</p>
<p>...Are you suggesting that coconuts migrate? Oh, ow! He hasn't got shit all over him. We shall say 'Ni' again to you, if you do not appease us. What do you mean? Well, I got better.</p>

<h2><a href='post4.html'>doctor who
</a> - january 3rd
</h2><hr /><p>I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks! Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time! Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I've always known him: Jeff. Annihilate? No. No violence. I won't stand for it. Not now, not ever, do you understand me?! I'm the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm - and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn't you?</p>
